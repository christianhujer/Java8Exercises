# The Particle Physicists View on User Stories

As you can read in User Stories aren't always User Stories, I categorize requirements into four groups:
* Molecular Structures: Epics
* Atoms: (Proper) User Stories
* Particles: Acceptance Criteria (of other User Stories)
* Energy Fields: Definition of Done

Maybe you are a particle physicist and would like to understand this granule of user stories in terms familiar to you.
In that case, I have this to offer to you:

* Epics are like Molecular Structures.
* User Stories are like Atoms.
* Acceptance Criteria are like Particles.
* Definition of Done is like an Energy Field.

## Explanation

### User Stories are like Atoms
Like Atoms, real User Stories are "indivisible".
It's not possible to split a real User Story further without destroying its business value, reducing it to zero.

Note that there are teams who work with bigger User Stories that could actually be divided further.
As long as team and business can deal with that, it's fine, even good.

There are also teams who cannot work with real User Stories properly because they are too slow.
Sometimes teams cannot deliver proper increments in business value to their software products within a week or at least an iteration.
That is a smell.
The reasons for this should be analyzed and removed.

### Epics are like Molecules
Molecules are complex structures consisting of multiple Atoms.
So are Epics, they are complex structures consisting of multiple User Stories.

### Acceptance Criteria are like Particles
